* [Studying Attitudes and Social Norms in Agile Software Development (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09225.pdf) by Lucas Gren
    > This paper reviews research on attitudes and social norms and connect it to the agile software development context. Author proposes additional theories from social psychology that would most certainly be useful for further sense-making of human factors-related research on agile teams.

* [Happiness and the productivity of software engineers (2019)](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1904/1904.08239.pdf) by Daniel Graziotin & Fabian Fagerholm
    > This paper provides an overview of studies on the happiness of software developers. You will learn why it is important to make software developers happy, how happy they really are, what makes them unhappy, and what is expected for their productivity while developing software.

* [Why Software Projects need Heroes (Lessons Learned from 1100+ Projects) (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09954.pdf) by Suvodeep Majumder, Joymallya Chakraborty, Amritanshu Agrawal & Tim Menzies
    > This paper explores the effect of having heroes in projects, from a code quality perspective. Authors identify the hero developers of 1100+ open source GitHub projects. Based on the analysis, they find the majority of all projects are *"hero" projects* and commits from *hero developers* (who contribute the most code) result in far fewer bugs than other developers -- which is contrary to the literature.
